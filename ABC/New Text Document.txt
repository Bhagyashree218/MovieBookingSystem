- add logistics project on git
- check if there is anything pending to backup

plant out happens with reader but 
get in doesnt
Reader not working at Get In 
check out if it already exist
if code already exist make it work
if not, add


if weighbridge transaction status is completed only then the jobmilestone should status should get completed

What this actually does
It only:
Cancels the last weighbridge transaction row
Reopens milestone
But it does NOT block future updates
So later:
AX4 sends new weight
System accepts it
New GW is written again
💥 That is the exact bug.


2. Some vehicles are showing as AX4 remark is underweight/overweight , but in Urge Truck, they are proceeding to invoicing.
As soon as AX4 writes that remark
Urge Truck:
❌ Does NOT enter invoicing logic
❌ Does NOT move to next milestone
✅ Forces Sales Audit

Fixed: this bug will not occur anymore
✅ Vehicles with AX4 under/overweight remarks cannot reach invoicing


✅ Current situation (confirmed)

Right now your code has this order inside
getNextMilestoneDetailAsync() 👇

if (lastWeghmentDetail.Status == MilestoneStatusConstants.Cancelled && ...)
{
    ...
}
else if (lastWeghmentDetail.Status != MilestoneStatusConstants.Completed)
{
    ...
    return returnMessage;
}
else if (lastWeghmentDetail.Status == MilestoneStatusConstants.Completed
         && lastWeghmentDetail.Remarks == "Overweight, Connect Sales Audit.")
{
    retValue = "SALESAUDIT";
}
else
{
    // approval / next milestone / invoicing
}

⚠️ This is WHY the bug exists.


✅ Final correct order (ONLY relevant part)
if (lastWeghmentDetail.Status == MilestoneStatusConstants.Cancelled && ...)
{
    ...
}
else if (lastWeghmentDetail.Status == MilestoneStatusConstants.Completed
         && lastWeghmentDetail.Remarks == "Overweight, Connect Sales Audit.")
{
    retValue = "SALESAUDIT";
}
else if (lastWeghmentDetail.Status != MilestoneStatusConstants.Completed)
{
    ...
    return returnMessage;
}
else
{
    // approval / next milestone / invoicing
}
